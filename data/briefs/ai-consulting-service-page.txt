You are writing a website content page for BT Web Group.

TASK
Write a content page for: "BT Web Group AI Consulting Services" that converts qualified business decision-makers into consultation/inquiry submissions.

AUDIENCE
Business owners, COOs, Ops Directors, CMOs, and marketing leaders at mid-market or scaling SMBs who want practical AI outcomes without hype. They care about ROI, risk, and clear deliverables.

PRIMARY POSITIONING
Strategy-first AI consulting that turns business objectives into realistic AI use cases + a clear implementation roadmap. AI is not the product; business outcomes are.

TONE
Clear, grounded, warm, confident. Plain English. Minimal jargon. Short sentences. Strong verbs. No motivational poster voice. No "big consulting brochure" voice.

HARD CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
1) Do NOT invent: named clients, industries not provided, numeric outcomes (%, $, time saved), awards, certifications, partnerships, or "success stories."
2) Do NOT write generic hype intros about AI changing the world.
3) Avoid these phrases entirely:
   - "In today's"
   - "rapidly evolving landscape"
   - "unlock the power"
   - "cut through the hype"
   - "one-size-fits-all"
   - "future-proof"
   - "revolutionize"
   - "transform"
   - "best-in-class"
   - "synergy"
   - "robust"
   - "leveraging"
4) Do NOT repeat the same claim in multiple sections with slightly different wording. Each section must add new information.

PROOF POLICY
Use proof_level = "soft".
- "soft" means: allowed: "Case studies available upon request" and "Typical outcomes include..." (no numbers).

PAGE TYPE
page_type = "service_page".
- "service_page" means: fuller explanation, process, deliverables, FAQs.

DRAFT MODE
draft_mode = "publish".
- "internal" means: keep [VERIFY] and [PLACEHOLDER] markers for human review, consolidate them in an "Inputs Needed" section at the end.
- "publish" means: no [VERIFY] or [PLACEHOLDER] tags anywhere. Write around unconfirmed items with safe, general language. Output must be ready to publish as-is.

OUTPUT FORMAT
Write in clean, HTML-ready Markdown.
- Use H1 once.
- Use H2 for major sections, H3 for sub-sections.
- Keep paragraphs under 4 lines.
- Use bullets for skimmability where helpful.
- Include 2 CTA blocks: one near the top, one near the bottom.
- Include ONE comparison block: either a short bullet comparison OR a short table-like section using bullets (but not an actual table).

REQUIRED STRUCTURE (service_page)
1) H1 + subhead (practical outcomes, strategy-first)
2) What we do (clear, early)
3) Strategy-first vs tool-first comparison block (single block)
4) Services (deliverables-forward) — include:
   - AI Readiness Assessment
   - Use Case Discovery + Prioritization
   - Roadmap + Implementation Plan
   - Pilot support + measurement
   - Adoption support (training/change management)
5) Process (step-by-step) — each step includes a deliverable
6) What you'll walk away with (tangible outputs list)
7) Risk, privacy, and practicality (address concerns directly)
8) Proof section (must follow PROOF POLICY)
9) FAQs (short, real)
10) Final CTA (what happens next, simple)

EXAMPLES (allowed, but must stay generic)
You may include 3–5 example use cases as examples only, framed as "Examples include:" and NOT as completed client work. Examples should be realistic for business operations and marketing.

INPUT FACTS (use only these as "facts"; do not add new facts)
No additional input facts provided.
